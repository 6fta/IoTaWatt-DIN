Home Assistant (HA) is an open source project that
provides local control and privacy for home automation devices.
It runs on a local server or Raspberry Pi and provides a robust
dashboard as well as mobile device app that can be used to view
and control the state of hundreds of home automation devices.

There is an energy management component in Home Assistant that
provides a comprehensive dashboard visualizing grid usage, solar
generation and battery system usage. Visit their `energy management
page <https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/08/04/home-energy-management/>`_
for detailed insight. 

There is an *integration* within Home Assistant that makes it
easy to use the energy comp[onent to it's fullest.  This section will
detail how to setup Home Assistant and IoTaWatt to make it all work.
